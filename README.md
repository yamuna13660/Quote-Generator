# Quote-Generator
This is a simple and interactive Quote Generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a new random quote every time the user clicks the "Generate Quote" button. The quotes are stored in a JavaScript array, and each quote is shown dynamically on the webpage. Itâ€™s a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation, arrays, and event handling in JavaScript.
